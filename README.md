# Rentify - Where Renting Meets Simplicity

This project is a full-stack application developed for the Rentify coding challenge.

## Getting Started
![Homepage](image.png)
### Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes bundled with Node.js)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Initialize a new Node.js project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Initialize a new React project (if you're using Create React App):
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app .
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

### Start the Backend Server

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Start the Frontend Development Server

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Reference

The frontend setup instructions are based on the official Create React App documentation:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
